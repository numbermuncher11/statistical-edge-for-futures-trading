Using R to find a statistical edge in the futures market

This is an Rmarkdown project that demonstrates how to use R to find a statistical edge in trading the futures market. This project focuses on the treasury market, specifically the ZN, TN, and ZB instruments. The role of correlations in helping to find a statistical edge will be investigated.

Tick data will be used in this project. The tick data was acquired from Sierracharts trading software. Unfortunately tick data will not be provided with the source code due to licensing issues.
